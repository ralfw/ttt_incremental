# Tic Tac Toe Requirements
Write a small game application to let 2 people play Tic Tac Toe (TTT) at the same computer. A description of the game can be found [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

The program should provide a simple GUI for the desktop and be installed locally.

When the program is started, a new game is presented to the players. Player X is the first one to draw.

A game is over if a player wins or when all fields on the game board are occupied. This should be flagged by the program.

A new game can be started at any time.
