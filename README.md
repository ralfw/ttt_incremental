Tic Tac Toe - Implemented incrementally
===============

Agile software design is about time.

A snapshot of a software structure tells little about how well it evolves regardless of the principles which guided its design.
That's why I present the implementation of a Tic Tac Toe desktop application as a series of iterations each implementing a small increment of the requirements.

Each iteration focuses on the minimal structure that's needed just for the requirements in question. No provisions for future requirements are made. That way each iteration is kind of "surprised" by a new small set of requirements. This is to show how well a codebase evolves if based on two principles I call _Integration Operation Segregation Principle (IOSP)_ and _Principle of Mutual Oblivion (PoMO)_.

But there is not only code to be found here. Look into the docs folder and you'll find a short requirements analysis as well as an extensive solution design.

The analysis looks at the entire scope at once. The design, though, takes only small bits from the analysis to think them through in preparation for quick implementation. Most iterations are covered by several commits so you can see how the code grows. Also watch the timestamps on the commits: you'll see that implementation "bursts" really took just a couple of minutes.

The method used I call _Flow Design_ (or "OOP as if you meant it" or "Radical Object-Orientation"). You can read about it in my [English blog](http://geekswithblogs.net/theArchitectsNapkin/default.aspx) or in a couple of [books I wrote](http://leanpub.com/u/ralfw).

The phases requirements analysis, solution design, and implementation are introduced in [this article on agile functional design.](http://geekswithblogs.net/theArchitectsNapkin/archive/2014/09/27/how-agility-leads-to-functional-design-and-even-tdd.aspx)

Enjoy!
